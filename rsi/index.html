        <h2>RSI INTERNAL RESUME</h2>
        <p>Rural Sourcing, Inc (RSI) provides specialized IT services for companies and thus is  continually developing new software applications. In order to ensure that employees are put on projects that match their current skill levels, they are encouraged to update their internal resumes frequently. The current process of updating their internal resumes and searching through internal resumes is a very manual and tedious one. The web app that I worked on aimed to reduce the amount of manual labor it takes to create, maintain, and search through internal resumes.
        </p>

        <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>Q. How long?
                <br>A. 2 months</p>
            <p>Q. With whom?
                <br>A. Individual at first, but then switched to team
            </p>
            <p>Q. Using what?
                <br>A. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, Flask, jQuery, Bootstrap, Balsamiq, PyCharm, AWS, MySQL
            </p>

        <h2>PROCESS</h2>
        <p>As projects develop, there are bound to be major changes. The internal resumes project started out as an individual project where I was the only person working on it, but changed midway into a more complicated application that required a team of people to work on it. I will explain my role both prior and post the project change.
        </p>
        <p><i>Individual Project:</i>
            <br>Originally, I created a web form that was hosted on the cloud through Amazon Web Services. The backend was developed in Python using Flask as its framework. The frontend was developed using the Bootstrap framework to maintain consistency with RSI’s other internal applications. The information entered into the web form was stored into a MySQL database. During the lifespan of the project, I developed an interactive web form UI that saved user entries into a database.
            </p>
        <p><i>Team Project:</i>
            <br>The project shifted from a basic web form into a more complicated user portal system with a focus on being able to manage and search for employees by “skill.” Basically, the scope of the web application expanded way beyond just a web form. As the new team was forming, I was tasked with the responsibility of creating UI wireframes for the portal. Working closely with the client, I used Balsamiq to iteratively design the UI features and functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>RESULT</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, the internship program ended before the completion of the project. While I did not get to see the project out until the end, I gained valuable experience in terms of backend web development, user interface design, and working on a professional software development team.
