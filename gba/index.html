        <h2>GAMEBOY ADVANCE GAMES</h2>
        <p>I developed two games in C using a GameBoy Advance emulator. This was my first time developing in C and working in Ubuntu. Each game was inspired by some of my favorite games growing up.
        </p>

        <h2>WORD'S HARDEST GAME: FIRE EMBLEM EDITION</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this game is to try to suicide run across the screen and not get hit by the enemies that are blocking your way. After you make it across, you have to defeat the final commander that is sitting on a fire breathing dragon.
        </p>

            <img src="../img/gba_awakening_dragon.png" class = "gba_img"/>
        </div>

        <h2>SOMETHING FISHY</h2>
        <p>Something Fishy is a game that I used to play when I was very young. You start out as a small fish (or in my case, a small white square), and you eat fish smaller than you in order to get bigger. If you get eaten, you lose a life. Once you have become the largest fish in the ocean without losing all your lives, youâ€™ve won the game.
