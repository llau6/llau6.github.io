        <h2>INPO CO-OP PROGRAM WEBSITE</h2>
        <p>I worked in the Institute of Nuclear Technology Co-op Program as a Technical Analyst working in the IT department. The co-op program hosts its own website to give potential new hires a better understanding and feel for the program. The issue with the website was that it had not been updated for the last 4 years! The site wreaked of early 2000s HTML and needed a major facelift. I used this opportunity to officially dive into the world of web development as well as gain kudos from my company.

        <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>Q. How long?
            <br>A. 1 month</p>
        <p>Q. With whom?
            <br>A. Individual Projecy</p>
        <p>Q. Using what?
            <br>A. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, WebStorm
        </p>

        <h2>TOOLS</h2>
        <p><i>Bootstrap Framework:</i>
            <br>I chose to work in the Bootstrap framework to take advantage of its fluid grid system. The dated INPO website was not a responsive website and with the growing number of different devices, this fault was becoming glaringly more obvious. Aside from its grid system, I also utilized many of Bootstrap’s readily-available HTML and CSS components. This was very helpful for me as I familiarized myself more with HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p><i>jQuery:</i>
            <br>I decided to learn JavaScript and jQuery simultaneously. Being the most popular JavaScript library, I wanted see what all the hubbub was about. While I by no means learned everything there was to learn about the framework, I realized how much JavaScript code can be shortened by incorporating jQuery.
        </p>
        <p><i>WebStorm</i>
            <br>Already familiar with similar JetBeans IDE, IntelliJ IDEA, picking up WebStorm was a no-brainer. The IDE continues to be a simple and powerful environment for client-side development.
        </p>

        <h2>DESIGN</h2>
        <p>Much of the information on the old website was redundant, hard to locate, or illogically placed. There was very little thought that went into user experience and I wanted to change that.
        </p>
        <p><i>Homepage:</i>
            <br>Right on the front page, you are greeted with a large carousel of pictures of the company building, both inside and out. I chose to present the user with large images of the company right away to give the user a sense of welcoming and introduction to the company. This differs from the old website where the homepage greeted you with a wall of text. Once the user has gained a feel for the company visually, they can scroll down to read a brief overview of the co-op program and our mission statement.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/inpo_home.png" style="margin-bottom: 2em"/>
        <p><i>About:</i>
            <br>I wanted the about page to hold the boring, but necessary information on the website. It contains a blurb about the company and its goals, an interactive Google Maps image with our location pinned, and the images and contact information of the co-op program’s managers. This serves as a quick snapshot of the company.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/inpo_map.png" style="width: 80%; margin-bottom: 1em"/>
        <img src="../img/inpo_card.png" style="width: 80%; margin-bottom: 2em"/>
        <p><i>Co-Op Program:</i>
            <br>One of the most confusing aspects of the old website was its poor explanation about the co-op program structure. It failed to address the fact that there were TWO different co-op programs (software development and infrastructure) and not just one. I wanted to illustrate this visually by juxtaposing the two different programs side by side and explaining the differences. Each program then has its own dedicated page that you can navigate to by clicking the “Read More” button.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/inpo_program.png" style="width: 80%; margin-bottom: 2em "/>
        <p>Another section of the website that I revamped was the Student Testimonials section. The old Student Testimonials page featured a grid of pictures with the student’s name, work period, school, and job titles listed underneath. Clicking on the image would direct you to a separate page with the same information along with a couple of paragraphs written by the co-op explaining their time at the company.
        </p>
        <p>I decided to change this grid into a horizontal scroll to simulate a timeline. This horizontal layout maps the descending years that co-ops worked more effectively than a grid. Then underneath each picture, I listed only the most important information--their name and working terms. By clicking on the picture, instead of redirecting you to a whole new page, I used jQuery to update the current page and change the block of text to that particular co-op’s written testimonial. This allows the user to be able to more quickly read through multiple testimonials without constantly being redirected to a different page.
